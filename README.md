# Connect 4 Game with various AIs implemented in SWI Prolog

## Run

First copy `src/bootstrap.example.pl` to `src/bootstrap.pl` and edit it to configure the game.
```bash
cp src/bootstrap.example.pl src/bootstrap.pl
```

Then, run `run.sh` on Unix or `run.bat` on Windows.

As of now, the IA selection is done by selecting which files to load, editing the run file.
